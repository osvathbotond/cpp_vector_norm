# cpp_vector_norm
This is my first C++ program. It's an lp vector norm calculator. It can only utilize the CPU at the moment, but it can work in serial and parallel as well. In the future, I'm planning to add support for GPUs as well.

This is my project for my elective subject "Scientific Programming of Graphical Processors" at Eötvös Loránd University.
